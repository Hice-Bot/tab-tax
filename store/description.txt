🧠 TAB TAX — Break the Cycle of Mindless Browsing

You know the feeling. You sit down to get work done, and twenty minutes later you're deep in a YouTube rabbit hole wondering how you got there. It wasn't a choice — it was a reflex. Tab Tax fixes that.

🤔 WHAT IS TAB TAX?

Tab Tax is a lightweight Chrome extension that puts a moment of friction between you and your distraction sites. Instead of instantly loading Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, or any site you add to your list, Tab Tax intercepts you and asks you to complete a quick mental challenge first — a math quiz, a memory test, or a typing challenge.

It's not a blocker. It's a tax.

You can still visit those sites. You just have to earn it. That 10-second pause is enough to break the autopilot loop and make the visit a deliberate choice instead of a reflex.

💡 WHY IT WORKS

Mindless browsing doesn't happen because you're lazy — it happens because it's frictionless. Your brain is wired to follow the path of least resistance, and clicking a bookmark or typing a URL takes almost zero effort.

Tab Tax adds just enough friction to interrupt the habit loop. In behavioral psychology, this is called a "commitment device" — a small obstacle that forces you to consciously decide whether you actually want to do the thing. Most of the time, once you stop and think, you'll realize you don't.

Studies show that even a 10–20 second delay dramatically reduces impulsive digital behavior. Tab Tax harnesses this science in the simplest possible way.
